let a="8"; //datatype is string
let b=8; //datatype is number

console.log(a == b);


//and our answer is true because here, 
// == check only values not datatypes so our output will be true
// and if we change the a's value then our output will be false.


// console.log(a === b); and if we want to check values as well as datatypes so we need "===".
// if we put there === then our program will check datatype as well as values.
